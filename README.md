It works again! Thanks [pastudan](https://github.com/pastudan)

If you are a forum administrator, you might want to check out https://github.com/pastudan/photobucket-imgur which has some scripts to auto re-upload all forum images and replace your database entries with working imgur versions.

# Photobucket Embed Fix

Also Available in Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/photobucket-embed-fix/naolkcpnnlofnnghnmfegnfnflicjjgj

## NOTE: You may need to clear your browser cache (at least for images) before you will be able to see some images (if you already tried to view them before installing this)

Photobucket recently updated their TOS to disable third party embedding unless the user who owns the photos pays $299.

# TL;DR;

If you're tired of seeing this image across the web:

[Install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/photobucket-embed-fix/naolkcpnnlofnnghnmfegnfnflicjjgj), and you should see the actual image.
